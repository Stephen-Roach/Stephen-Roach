<br />

Growing up as a kid I always told myself that I thought I could do anything, as long as I had Google to help me figure it out. I suppose it's safe to say
that I feel right at home!

### A little about me!
I am Full-Stack Engineer who will be graduating from DigitalCrafts Full Stack Development Bootcamp in January! 

I am passionate about the web and all things technology. Creative Software Engineer with the ability to pick up new languages and technologies as needed. I primarily enjoy working in a team, sharing ideas, learning and problem-solving.

I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything! I love meeting new people and learning new technologies. Just ask away!

Fun Fact: I am the biggest Harry Potter Geek around⚡️
